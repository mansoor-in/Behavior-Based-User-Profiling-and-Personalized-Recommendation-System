# Behavior-Based User Profiling and Personalized Recommendation System

This project develops a behavior-based user profiling system that utilizes data-driven techniques to analyze user behavior and generate personalized recommendations. It leverages machine learning models to predict user preferences and improve recommendation accuracy.

## Features
- **User Profiling**: Creates detailed profiles based on user behavior data.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggests tailored content or items for users.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements algorithms to predict user preferences.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Includes methods to evaluate the performance of the recommendation system.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/behavior-based-user-profiling.git
   cd behavior-based-user-profiling
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open `Behavior_Based_User_Profiling_and_Personalized_Recommendation_System.ipynb` to explore the code and functionality.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`

## Usage
1. Load your dataset into the notebook.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess data, train models, and generate recommendations.
3. Visualize user profiling insights and recommendation results.

## File Structure
- `Behavior_Based_User_Profiling_and_Personalized_Recommendation_System.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the project code.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of dependencies required for the project.

## Future Improvements
- Enhance profiling techniques using advanced behavioral models.
- Implement deep learning-based recommendation systems for improved accuracy.
- Add real-time recommendation capabilities.
